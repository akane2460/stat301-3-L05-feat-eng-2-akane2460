## Overview

The goal of this lab is to (1) expand our feature engineering understanding and (2) introduce a new model type: **M**ultivariate **A**daptive **R**egression **S**plines (MARS).

## Instructions

After creating your own github repository and connecting it to your RStudio, you should work through the questions provided in `LO5_feature_engineering_II.html`. A template is provided (rename as `lastname_firstname_L05.qmd`).

You will only need to submit the rendered html file which should contain a link to your github repo. Including the github repo link takes the place of having to submit the additional qmd and r files. See canvas for submission details.


# In this repo...
- R scripts including the work for the answers provided in the qmd and html
- `Kane_Allison_L05.html` contains the answers for the lab
- `Kane_Allison_L05.qmd` contains the answers for the lab
